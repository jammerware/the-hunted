# The Hunted
Welcome to _The Hunted_, a mod for [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) that adds a new player class! It's called The Hunted. But I bet you got that far on your own.

Follow my dev diary [here](https://benstein.io/blog/tag/project-the-hunted), and check out my hilariously inefficient Trello board for the project [here](https://trello.com/b/yaiaCW0X/slay-the-spire-the-hunted)!

# Installation
When I'm closer to public beta, I'll put it in the Steam Workshop for easy installation. If you want to horse around with it beforehand, go nuts! You need the aforementioned _Slay the Spire_ (which you should have already. It's great!) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to build it. Once it's installed and added to your path, just download or clone my code and run this in the root of the directory:

```
mvn package
```

Take the resulting `.jar` and put it in your `steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire/mods` folder (you may have to create the `mods` bit), and then run the game with mods enabled from Steam. Easy... peasy?

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, just create a new [issue](https://github.com/jammerware/the-hunted/issues/new)on Github. Thanks for looking!
